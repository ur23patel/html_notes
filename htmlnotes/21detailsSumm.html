    <h1>&lt;details&gt;: The Details disclosure element</h1>
    <p>The &lt;details&gt; HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the &lt;summary&gt; element.</p>
    <p>A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. The contents of the &lt;summary&gt; element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Details</summary>
        Something small enough to escape casual notice.
    </details>
