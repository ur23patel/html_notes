    <p>Reading is important for many reasons, such as learning new things, expanding the mind and boosting imagination. Many people also read for pleasure, which in turn can help the reader relax and better handle the stress in her life.</p>

        The ability to read opens countless doors of exploration and learning. Children are taught to read early on because much of their education comes from reading textbooks and assignments. It is a skill that, once learned, is continually used and exercised into adulthood. Reading is one of the best ways to gain a general knowledge of almost anything.
